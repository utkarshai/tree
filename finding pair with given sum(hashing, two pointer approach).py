#  two pointer approach
# Approach: Two Different methods have already been discussed here. Here, a method based on sorting will be discussed.

# Sort the array and take two pointers i and j, one pointer pointing to the start of the array i.e. i = 0 and another pointer pointing to the end of the array i.e. j = n â€“ 1.
# If arr[i] + arr[j] is
# Greater than the sum then decrement j.
# Lesser than the sum then increment i.
# Equals to the sum then count such pairs.
